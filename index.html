    <h2>Proposition: White police officers discriminate against Black people.</h2>

		<section>
      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="PRO.png" alt="White police officers DO discriminate against Black people." />
				<figcaption>
					Data showing the breakdown of officer ethnicity and complainant ethnicity. The left most subgraph shows the 
					data in a stacked bar graph form, while the two subgraphs on the right help the viewer digest the information 
					via ethnicity fractions of the whole.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>redundant data (-1)</li>
				<li>pie charts and bar chart (0)</li>
				<li>color coordinate (2)</li>
				<li>specified ethnicities (0)</li>
				<li>bar chart on the left (1)</li>
			</ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="CON.png" alt="White police officers DO NOT discriminate against Black people." />
				<figcaption>
					Data showing percentages of substantiated complaints by ethnicity of the complainant and officer, as well as the breakdown of crimes committed by ethnicity. 
					The top left most subgraph shows rates of substantiated complaints out of all of the complaints filed by complainants of a given ethnicity. 
					The bottom left most subgraph shows rates of substantiated complaints out of all of the complaints filed under officers of a given ethnicity. 
					The right most subgraph shows the alleged contact reason that led to officers to interact with complainants, and breaks down the ethnicity of the complainants within the categories via a stack bar representation.

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>log scale and ordering within (-1)</li>
				<li>color code (2)</li>
				<li>excluding contradictory data (-2)</li>
				<li>grouping related data (0)</li>
				<li>specified ethnicities (0)</li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>While reading through the specs of this assignment, I was not sure how I was going to use the same data to show contradictory points. 
		I think that it was a worthwhile exercise because it helped me figure out and apply techniques that are used all around me, deceptive or not, to visualize data.
