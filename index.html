    <h2>Proposition: White police officers discriminate against Black people.</h2>

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>

					Data showing the breakdown of officer ethnicity and complainant ethnicity. The left most subgraph shows the 
					data in a stacked bar graph form, while the two subgraphs on the right help the viewer digest the information 
					via ethnicity fractions of the whole.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>redundant data (-2):</b> 
					The data that we were given listed each complaint as its own entry, so a given officer could be listed multiple times within the data if multiple allegations were proposed against him/her. 
					That said, for this data representation, I tallied the number of times a given ethnicity appeared in the data sheet, knowingly overcounting individual officers. 
					While this technique is certainly deceptive, it helped make my visualization more persuasive as it strengthened the point that I was making: there are a lot of white officers who get compaints from black people. 
				</li>
				<li><b>pie charts and bar chart (0): </b>
					In this visualization, I graphed the same data in different ways so that the reader could more easily internalize it from different perspectives. 
					While, on the one hand readers may assume that the different charts convey fundamentally different information which is slightly decpetive, I clearly labled the content and think that even a preliminary screen of the content will make it clear that I choose to plot the same information using various visualizations to emphasize different aspects of it (magnitude and proportions).
				</li>
				<li><b>color coordinate (2): </b>
					In this visualization, I intentionally coordinated the colors for each of the subgraphs to help the viewers digest the information, with the benefit of signaling underlying unification across the subplots. 
					Coordinating the colors really helped bring together the subplots, and enhanced the visual appeal of the chart as a whole.
				</li>
				<li><b>specified ethnicities (0): </b>
					For this graph, I chose to only include data entries that had specitied ethnicities (i.e. American Indian, Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White, and not those listed in the 'Null', 'Refused', 'Unknown' or 'Other' categories).
					The reason that this worked well is because it removed ambiguity from the data that could have been used to doubt my proposition. 
					I belive that this technique was not particularly deceptive, but conceed that it was not the most earnest choice that I could make as I did intentionally exclude data to strengthen my claim.
				</li>
				<li><b>bar chart on the left (0): </b>
					Another one of the active decisions that I made when putting together this graph was how to arrange the sub plots. 
					In the end, I decided to put the par graph on the right and the pie charts on the left because I wanted readers to first pay attention to the bar graph and understand it, and then turn their attention to the pie charts which reitterated the information from a different vantage point. 
					Since English reads left to right, I assumed that after reading the title of my graph the reader would automatically point their eyes to right below it on the left side of the page, hence the positioning decision. 
				</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="CON.png" alt="White police officers DO NOT discriminate against Black people." />
				<figcaption>
					Data showing percentages of substantiated complaints by ethnicity of the complainant and officer, as well as the breakdown of crimes committed by ethnicity. 
					The top left most subgraph shows rates of substantiated complaints out of all of the complaints filed by complainants of a given ethnicity. 
					The bottom left most subgraph shows rates of substantiated complaints out of all of the complaints filed under officers of a given ethnicity. 
					The right most subgraph shows the alleged contact reason that led to officers to interact with complainants, and breaks down the ethnicity of the complainants within the categories via a stack bar representation.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>log scale and ordering within (-1): </b> 
					In order to make it look like Black people do not submit the most allegations out of any ethnicity, I used a log scale for the chart on the right. 
					While this technique worked well to trick surface level readers who glance at my data that Whites are actually the ethnicity who submit the most complaints, I will admit the deceptive nature of this choice. 
					That said, readers to take the time to simply read the axes will quickly realize that shaded area on the screen does not correlate to the ratio of submited complaints within the subgroups, and since axes are criticle to read when trying to understand a graph and I did not shrink the font size or make it particularly challenging to read, I ranked the deception a -1 on the -2 to 2 scale. 
				</li>
				<li><b>color code (2): </b>
					In this visualization, I intentionally coordinated the colors for each of the subgraphs to help the viewers digest the information, with the benefit of signaling underlying unification across the subplots. 
					That said, I did consider an alternative: making the bars on the left two subplots a single color. 
					While coordinating the colors help bring together the subplots, the color coding was redundantly communicating the the ethnicities in the visualizations on the left which seemed unnecessary. 
					That said, after much deliberation, I made the choice of coordinating them with the colors on the right chart as doing so enhances the visual appeal of the chart as a whole and helps readers more easily correlate information across the subplots.
				</li>
				<li><b>excluding contradictory data (-2): </b>
					In the process of plotting the right subchart, I choose to exclude all of the crime categories that appeared to have most of the total bar representing people of the Black ethnicity. 
					This was a very deceptive decision of mine, but it worked really well to support my claim. 
					While I considered leaving them in as the majority of the crimes still appear to have other ethnicities as their main committers (thanks to the log scale), in the end I decided to remove them to stengthen my arguement. 
				</li>
				<li><b>grouping related data (0): </b> 
					There were some crime categories that were quite similar, like 'PD suspected C/V of violation/crime - street' and 'PD suspected C/V of violation/crime - bldg', as doing so made my data easier to format and read (particularly the bin names on the x axis). 
					Since the difference between the categories was irrelevant for my message and the categories had similar breakdowns of ethnicities allegidly at fault, I do not belive that combining them particulary obstructed the reader for acurately reading the data.
					Thus, I do not think merging the content was particularly deceptive or earnest.
					I also removed some crime categories (such as C/V intervened on behalf of/observed encounter w/3rd party) that had no or minimal data samples as they did not contribute nor detract from my message.
				</li>
				<li><b>specified ethnicities (0): </b> 
					For this graph, I chose to only include data entries that had specitied ethnicities (i.e. American Indian, Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White, and not those listed in the 'Null', 'Refused', 'Unknown' or 'Other' categories).
					The reason that this worked well is because it removed ambiguity from the data that could have been used to doubt my proposition. 
					I belive that this technique was not particularly deceptive, but conceed that it was not the most earnest choice that I could make as I did intentionally exclude data to strengthen my claim.

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
		While reading through the specs of this assignment, I was not sure how I was going to use the same data to show contradictory points. 
		I think that it was a worthwhile exercise because it helped me figure out and apply techniques that are used all around me, deceptive or not, to visualize data. 
		When reflecting on deceptive tactics I used, I realized that the commonality behind my reasoning was that I wanted to remove any reasonable doubt that my data contradicted my intended message. 
		What's more, is that when reasoning about my deceptive decisions, I often pointed to the claim that the reader would <em>probably</em> have agreed with my message even if it was included, but the deception just made it easier for them to do so. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Defining "ethical analysis and visualization" previously seemed straighforward: convey the data in an honestly. 
		But it is way more complex than that. 
		What counts as honestly? 
		Speaking from my experience with this assignement, there is an "I can't define it but I know it when I feel it" component to this answer. 
		More concretely though, there are bounds that I can draw between earnest and deceptive choices. 
		For instance, I would say that excluding data that literally contradicts your message is severely misleading and thus an unethical choice. 
		On the other hand, excluding data that does not strictly contradict your point, but makes it less certain is more of a morally ambiguous decision. 
		Reflecting on data visualization as a whole throughout this course is helping me refine my answer, and encouraging me to appreciate the complex nature of the ethics on data visualization.
